- This looks like a good start, but I would definitely try to simplify your modeling! The app should be as simple as possible to start. 
Ideally, you should not have more than 5 models. See if you can get by without `Comment` or `Group` models, etc.

- Also, make sure to use upper case for your model names. e.g., `Grouparticle` should be `GroupArticle`

Nice work.

Since `GroupArticle` is a separate model, the following routes should be separated into a `GroupArticlesController` as well.
The rule is generally that every model should have its own controller.

```
  get "/new_grouparticle/:group_id" => 'article#new_grouparticle'
  get "/new_grouparticle/" => 'article#new_grouparticle'
```

Be careful with case and singular vs. plural classes in your model, controllers, routes, and views. 
While the model class name is singular, all controllers and routes should be plural.
For example, the model `Article` should have an `ArticlesController` (plural), and routes such as `/articles/new`, `/articles/:id`, etc., or `resources :articles`.

Additionally, make sure to include underscores when referencing models such as `GroupArticle`, e.g. `def group_article` or `get /group_article/:group_id`

This may seem like a minor point, but it's important to follow Rails conventions, or your code will be difficult to follow.
